You are a senior software engineer, system designer, and EdTech architect.

Build a production-grade web application called:

"PrepOS – Intelligent DSA Placement Preparation Platform"

This platform must be inspired by Striver’s A2Z DSA Sheet from TakeUForward
(https://takeuforward.org/dsa/strivers-a2z-sheet-learn-dsa-a-to-z),
but MUST NOT scrape or copy proprietary content.

GOAL:
Create a smart, ethical, scalable placement preparation system that
guides students through DSA using structured roadmap, pattern-based learning,
analytics, and adaptive recommendations.

TARGET USERS:
2nd–4th year CSE students preparing for FAANG and product-based companies.

TECH STACK:
Frontend:
- React + TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Framer Motion

Backend:
- Node.js + Express
- MongoDB
- Redis (optional)

Auth:
- JWT + Google OAuth

CORE FEATURES:

1. DSA ROADMAP ENGINE
- Use A2Z sheet ONLY as a roadmap reference.
- Create your own structured dataset:
  - Topic
  - Subtopic
  - Pattern
  - Difficulty
  - External Practice Link
- Do NOT store problem statements.

2. LEGAL QUESTION FETCHING
- Fetch problem metadata ONLY from:
  - LeetCode public GraphQL APIs
  - Codeforces public APIs
  - Open-source GitHub datasets
- Store:
  - Problem title
  - Difficulty
  - URL
  - Tags
- Never scrape private content.

3. PATTERN-BASED LEARNING
- Each problem belongs to:
  - Topic (Array, Graph, DP)
  - Pattern (Sliding Window, Two Pointers, DP on Subsequences)
- Enable pattern-wise learning paths.

4. ADAPTIVE RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM
- Track:
  - Solve count
  - Accuracy
  - Time spent
- Recommend problems dynamically based on weaknesses.

5. PROGRESS & ANALYTICS
- Topic completion %
- Pattern mastery score
- Daily streaks
- Weak area detection

6. DASHBOARD
- Visual progress charts
- Today’s recommended problems
- Remaining roadmap

7. GAMIFICATION
- XP points
- Badges
- Weekly leaderboards

8. ADMIN PANEL
- Add/edit topics & patterns
- Map problems to roadmap
- Manage difficulty levels

NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Clean architecture
- Scalable REST APIs
- Secure auth
- Mobile-responsive UI

DELIVERABLES:
1. High-level system architecture
2. MongoDB schema
3. REST API design
4. Recommendation algorithm logic
5. Sample dataset (JSON)
6. GitHub-ready folder structure
7. Resume-ready project description
